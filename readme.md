## Prepare
Save that list to to a file `repositories.txt`.
The list should be in the form of "user_username/repo_name" per line, not a full URL!

### Example
An example of the completed file `repositories.txt`
> Quiss/Laravel4-lang  
> Quiss/git-flow-cheatsheet  
> Quiss/onetwomovie

## Run:
`bash removed.sh`
